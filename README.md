## About Me
Hi there! I'm a first-year college student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. I have a passion for technology and how it can transform the way we live and work. From coding to problem-solving, I enjoy learning about the various ways information systems are integrated into businesses and everyday life.

As I progress in my studies, I'm excited to dive deeper into areas like data management, software development, and network systems. I thrive in environments where I can collaborate with others, share ideas, and grow my skills. I’m also always on the lookout for opportunities to apply what I’m learning in real-world scenarios, whether through internships, projects, or just staying updated with the latest tech trends.
